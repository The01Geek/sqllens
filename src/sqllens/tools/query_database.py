"""``query_database`` MCP tool implementation.

The FastMCP tool wrapper (``mcp.server.fastmcp`` — the official MCP SDK, not
the separately-distributed standalone ``fastmcp`` package) in ``server.py``
re-raises any exception from this module and maps it to an ``isError: true``
result, currently formatting the client text as
``Error executing tool query_database: <message>``. Our contract is therefore
the *raised message* (the categorized text below), which the client receives
as the suffix after that wrapper prefix — the category split stays observable
because the forms here remain mutually distinguishable under it.

    The single agent path behind the consolidated ``query_database`` MCP tool.
    One ``agent.send_message`` run is buffered and collapsed in a single pass by
    :func:`~sqllens.tools._format.components_to_widgets`, which yields the
    Markdown answer (DataFrame tables + answer text, plus the fenced SQL block
    when ``agent.show_details`` is on), the structured table payload, the
    executed-SQL ``query_info``, and the structured chart payload when the
    agent emitted a ``ChartComponent``.

    Three error categories, unchanged: tool-internal failures raise
    ``_INTERNAL_ERROR_MESSAGE``, agent-reported SQL failures raise
    ``_SQL_EXECUTION_ERROR_PREFIX + answer``, and ``UnsafeSqlError`` is
    re-raised verbatim. ``table`` and ``chart`` are ``None`` on the error path
    or whenever the corresponding component is absent (apps-aware callers attach
    whichever is present to ``_meta``; everyone else ignores them and reads the
    Markdown). ``query_info`` carries the executed SQL when
    ``agent.show_details`` is on, ``None`` otherwise — and when present, the
    same SQL is also appended to ``markdown`` as a fenced ``sql`` block so
    plain-text clients see it too.

    ``memory_info`` carries the aggregate memory hit/miss signal whenever a
    memory search *completes* (a hit or a miss) this turn (``None`` otherwise —
    including a search that errored, and on the agent error path). It is
    surfaced regardless of ``agent.show_details``; when
    ``agent.show_memory_details`` is on, a one-line memory footer is also
    appended to ``markdown`` for plain-text clients.

    ``conversation_id`` is threaded into ``send_message`` so a follow-up turn
    loads the prior ``Conversation`` (its message history) and the agent can
    answer its own clarifying question. ``None`` lets the agent mint a fresh id
    internally; the MCP server layer mints and returns a stable id to the caller.
