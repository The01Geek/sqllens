"""SQL safety guards.

Three orthogonal protections, composed at the factory:

* ``assert_select_only`` / ``ReadOnlyGuardRunner`` — sqlglot parse rejects
  anything that isn't a single ``SELECT``/``WITH``.
* Per-runner statement timeouts (``SET statement_timeout`` on Postgres,
  ``SET SESSION MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`` on MySQL, ``set_progress_handler``
  deadline on SQLite) — server- or driver-side time bound.
* ``RowCapRunner`` — per-runner streaming via ``fetchmany`` stops at
  ``max_rows``; this decorator is the secondary belt-and-suspenders check
  on the returned DataFrame.
