# vendor-slice.sh — materialize the PRFlow plugin into the workspace
# ============================================================================
# The cloud-tier workflows reference plugin helpers at the literal workspace
# path `.prflow/vendor/prflow/…`. This script puts the plugin there at RUNTIME
# so the tree no longer has to be committed into a consumer repo. It is the ONE
# definition of "which files are the plugin" — install.sh sources it for the
# shared `devflow_copy_slice` function (see DEVFLOW_VENDOR_SOURCE below), and the
# vendor-plugin composite action executes it — so the copied set can never drift.
#
# Executed (the composite action), it follows a single deterministic algorithm,
# committed then fetch:
#   1. committed  — `.prflow/vendor/prflow/scripts` already in the checkout → use it (no-op).
#   2. fetch      — any other checkout → clone DEVFLOW_REF from DEVFLOW_REPO and copy it in.
# The fetch branch refuses to run without a pinned ref, so a thin consumer never
# silently tracks mutable `main`. The former copy-the-checkout branch is gone: the
# source repo itself is fetched too (its config names its own repository), so the
# clone, the ref pin, and the diagnostics are exercised here as in a consumer.
#
# Environment (all optional unless noted):
#   DEVFLOW_REF        git ref to fetch (REQUIRED on the fetch branch); a branch,
#                      tag, or commit SHA. Sourced from .prflow/config.json
#                      `prflow_version` by the workflows.
#   DEVFLOW_REPO       owner/name to fetch from (default The01Geek/prflow); sourced
#                      from .prflow/config.json `prflow_repo` by the workflows.
#   DEVFLOW_TOKEN      credential for the fetch clone. When non-empty the clone runs
#                      with a one-shot git credential helper answering username
#                      x-access-token and this token as the password, so a private or
#                      fork repository can be fetched. Empty → clone with no credential.
#   DEVFLOW_REPO_URL   full clone URL (default https://github.com/$DEVFLOW_REPO.git);
#                      overridable so tests can clone a local fixture offline.
#   DEVFLOW_DEST       destination dir (default .prflow/vendor/prflow); overridable for tests.
#   DEVFLOW_VENDOR_SOURCE=1  define functions and return WITHOUT running — for `source`rs.
# ============================================================================

  # into this same maintainer tree while it still lived directly under docs/, so
  # nothing a consumer executes references it; pruning it here stops
  # that reference tree shipping into every consumer and, because
  # lint-shipped-pruned-path.py derives its forbidden set from these rm arguments,
  # arms that lint against reintroduction), and PRFlow's own test suite
  # under lib/test (it asserts against install.sh and
  # .github/, which the slice does not copy, so it could only fail loudly in a
  # consumer tree). Placed after cp -R and before the sanity floor so the floor
  # evaluates the tree that actually ships; the whole $stage is rm -rf'd on any
  # floor failure, so this can never leave a partially-pruned tree at $dest (a
  # $stage orphan is still possible if this rm itself aborts — install.sh's sourced
  # copy has no $stage trap — but that never lands at $dest). Like the marketplace.json/
  # __pycache__ prunes above, rm -rf is a no-op on an absent path. It is left
  # unguarded, so an unexpected rm error aborts loudly under set -e — the preferred
  # fail direction here; the __pycache__ prune instead suppresses all errors
