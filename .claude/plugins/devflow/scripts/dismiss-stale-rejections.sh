# Dismiss Devflow Review's own still-outstanding CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews.
#
# Called after a Devflow Review APPROVE verdict to clear a prior REJECT's
# `--request-changes` review. GitHub keeps that review the PR's effective
# `reviewDecision` until it is *dismissed*: a later APPROVE-with-notes is a
# `--comment` review (never supersedes) and the REJECT may be a different
# bot identity (auto path = github-actions[bot], manual @claude = another),
# so no later review clears it. Without an explicit dismissal the PR is
# wedged at reviewDecision=CHANGES_REQUESTED despite a green required check.
#
# Scope: ONLY reviews whose body is a Devflow Review formal verdict are
# dismissed. Two body shapes are matched:
#   1. New stub format (post-#135 consolidation): the formal review body
#      starts with `## Verdict: REJECT` — the full Phase 4.1 report lives
#      in the progress comment, not the review body, so the review carries
#      only a short verdict stub.
#   2. Legacy format (pre-#135): the formal review body starts with
#      `# Review Report` (kept for backward compatibility with any
#      pre-consolidation reviews still outstanding on long-lived PRs).
# A human reviewer's `--request-changes` carries neither marker and is left
# untouched — an automated APPROVE must never silently clear a human's
# block.
#
# The caller decides WHEN to run this (APPROVE only — never on REJECT, the
# changes-request must stand). This script does not inspect the verdict.
#
# Usage: dismiss-stale-rejections.sh PR_NUMBER [REPO]
#   PR_NUMBER  the pull request number
#   REPO       owner/name; defaults to `$DEVFLOW_GH repo view`'s nameWithOwner
#
# Re-run safe: a dismissed review's state becomes DISMISSED so it no longer
# matches the filter; re-running this script after a successful pass is a
# genuine no-op. (It still dismisses any NEW Devflow-report CHANGES_REQUESTED
# that appeared since — that is the intended behavior, not non-idempotency.)
# Best-effort per review: a failed dismissal is logged and the rest still
# run; the verdict never depends on this housekeeping.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), jq. Needs pull-requests:write — the
# dismissals API can dismiss ANY reviewer's review (required for the
# cross-identity case). $DEVFLOW_GH overrides the `gh` binary for tests
# (same seam as the rest of devflow; see lib/fetch-pr-context.sh).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all matching reviews dismissed, or none were outstanding (no-op)
#   1  list query failed, or one or more dismissals failed (caller may
#      warn; never fatal there)
#   2  bad arguments
