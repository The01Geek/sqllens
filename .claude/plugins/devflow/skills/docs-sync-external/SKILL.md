description: Use when internal documentation has been updated and external customer-facing docs need to be aligned, or when checking for outdated, missing, or confidential content in external docs.
---
> **Configuration:** Read documentation paths from `.github/project-config.yml`:
> - Internal: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/config-get.sh .docs.internal docs/internal/`
> - External: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/config-get.sh .docs.external docs/external/`
>
> The helper falls back to the default value when the config file is missing or the key is absent. Use the results as `[[INTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]` and `[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]` throughout this skill.

# External Documentation Alignment Agent

## Objective
You are an **AI Documentation Alignment Agent**. Review **internal technical documentation** (`[[INTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]`), compare it with **external customer-facing documentation** (`[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]`), and update external docs to be accurate, customer-friendly, and free of confidential content.

## Preflight

Check the documentation trees before doing anything:
- If `[[INTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]` is empty or absent, there is no source of truth to align from — **stop** and report that internal docs should be created first (run `/docs-bootstrap-internal` or `/docs-sync-internal`).
- If `[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]` is empty or absent, this is a first-time bootstrap, not an alignment — **defer to `/docs-bootstrap-external`** rather than aligning against nothing.

## Execution Model

⚠️ **This prompt requires TWO actions:**
1. **Provide Status Summary** — Structured alignment report for each topic analyzed
2. **Actually Edit Documentation Files** — Make real file changes in `[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]`

**Both are mandatory.** Analysis without file edits is incomplete.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Analyze and Compare
Work on **one topic/feature at a time**.

Before creating new docs, **always search** for existing content:
1. Read `[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]*`
2. Search for relevant topics by file/directory names
3. If a topic exists, update it rather than creating a duplicate

Categorize findings as:
- ✅ **Aligned** — External matches internal truth
- ⚠️ **Outdated** — External references old or deprecated details
- ❌ **Missing** — Important internal information absent externally
- 🔒 **Internal-only** — Confidential information that must not appear externally

### 2. Draft Updates
For each **Outdated** or **Missing** item:
- Rewrite or extend the external documentation
- Use a customer-appropriate tone (concise, instructive, non-technical where possible)
- Follow the Style Guide below for writing and formatting standards
- Keep hub pages focused; create child pages for deep how-to's and troubleshooting
- Exclude confidential or internal-only details

### 3. Housekeeping
- Remove any **Internal-only** sections from external documentation
- Never create parent/hub documents
- Never remove existing images or attachments

---

## Content Guidelines

### Include:
- Feature descriptions and benefits
- User-facing workflows and processes
- Setup and configuration instructions (customer-level)
- Troubleshooting and FAQs
- Integration steps (from user perspective)
- Best practices and recommendations

### Exclude:
- Internal API implementation details
- Database schema or SQL scripts
- Internal build/deployment processes
- Proprietary algorithms or business logic
- Internal tooling or admin-only features
- Security-sensitive configuration details
- Third-party API keys or credentials

---

## File Naming
Use the naming convention: `{short-descriptive-name}.md` with concise, hyphenated names.

---

## Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: External docs must align with internal source of truth
- **Clarity**: Simple, clear language; avoid jargon
- **Completeness**: Cover all necessary user-facing aspects
- **Security**: Never expose confidential information
- **Consistency**: Consistent tone, terminology, and formatting

---

## Workflow Steps

**Step 1: Understand Context**
- Read `CLAUDE.md` for product overview
- Scan internal documentation (`[[INTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]`) for recent changes or new features

**Step 2: Compare Documentation**
- Compare with corresponding external documentation (`[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]`)
- Identify gaps, outdated content, or misalignments

**Step 3: Create/Update Files**
- Create/update external MD files in `[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]` as needed
- Follow all naming, formatting, and style guidelines from the Style Guide below

Only edit customer-facing files in `[[EXTERNAL_DOC_LOCATION]]` and its subdirectories.

## Style Guide

### Tone and Voice
- **Clear, straightforward, and informative**: Professional yet accessible
- Avoid jargon and overly technical language
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include helpful notes and tips where needed, but keep them concise
- Maintain a neutral, objective tone

### General Writing Guidelines
- **Audience**: Customers
- Use "and" instead of ampersands (&); write "percent" instead of %
- Punctuation outside quotes when quoting UI text
- Use colon format for defined terms in lists (**Term**: Description.)
- Use complete sentences in lists when possible
- Use full product name on first mention, then shorten naturally
- Use "user interface" instead of "UI"

### Content Organization
- Keep hub pages concise; break deep how-to's into separate pages
- Add short purpose line under each header
- Summarize processes in 2-3 sentences, then link to dedicated articles
- Add "See also" or "Related Articles" links
- Insert screenshot placeholders at UI/action points (e.g., "[Screenshot: Save button location]")

### Abbreviations and Numbers
- Spell out numbers < 10; use numerals >= 10
- Avoid Oxford comma per AP style
- Use ISO 4217 currency codes (USD, CAD, EUR)
- Use two-digit ISO country codes (US, UK, DE)
- Use B, MB, GB for file sizes

### Product and Technical Terms
- Write out acronyms on first use with abbreviation in parentheses
- Common technical terms (URL, HTTP, HTTPS) need not be written out
- **Log in** (verb), **login** (noun)
- **Set up** (verb), **setup** (noun)
- **Username**: One word; **File name**: Two words
- Prefer "use" over "utilize"
- Prefer "enter" over "type", "display" over "show"

### User Actions
- **Click**: Desktop (buttons, links); **Tap**: Mobile
- **Press**: Keyboard keys; **Select**: Dropdowns, menus
- Bold UI element names; omit element type unless needed for clarity

### MD Formatting
- Start page headings with H1; use title case for headings
- Bold UI elements; italics for emphasis
- Numbered steps for sequential processes only; imperative tone
- Start bullet items with capital letters
- Callouts: Bold label + colon (Note:, Tip:, Warning:); use sparingly
- Tables: Bold header row, left-align text, right-align numbers
- Never remove existing images or attachments
- Use fenced code blocks with proper indentation
