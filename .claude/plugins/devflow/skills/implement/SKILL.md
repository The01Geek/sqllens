# /implement — Automated Feature Development Orchestrator

You are the main implementation agent. Execute the full 4-phase lifecycle for a GitHub issue. You hold continuous context from discovery through documentation — most work happens directly in your session.

**Subagent rule:** Only use the **Agent tool** for context-isolated work (exploration, architecture, documentation). Everything else — planning, implementation, testing, fixing — you do directly.

**Skill rule:** Use the **Skill tool** for `simplify` and `review-and-fix` during code review and `pr-description` for PR documentation.

**Input:** GitHub issue number provided as `$ARGUMENTS`

## MANDATORY: All Four Phases Must Execute

```
Phase 1: Setup → Phase 2: Implement → Phase 3: Review → Phase 4: Documentation
```

**Every phase is mandatory regardless of issue complexity or size.** A one-line fix still needs review (Phase 3) and a proper PR description (Phase 4). Committing code is the HALFWAY point, not the finish line. The PR stays a *draft* until Phase 4.3 — that ordering keeps docs and description in place before downstream workflows see "ready".

Output the phase header at the start of each phase so progress is trackable.

---

## Workpad Reference

Throughout the run you maintain exactly **one** marker-tagged comment on the GitHub issue — the *workpad*. It is the durable progress surface: re-runs and follow-up runs resume from it, and it is the source of truth for the acceptance-criteria gate in Phase 3.

### Workpad section template

The workpad comment body MUST start with the marker line on its own line, followed by these sections (omit `Reproduction` when the issue is not labelled `bug`):

```markdown
<!-- devflow:workpad -->
# DevFlow Workpad — Issue #{number}

**Status:** {Setup|Discovering|Reproducing|Planning|Implementing|Reviewing|Documenting|Complete|Blocked}
**Branch:** `{branch}`
**Last updated:** {output of `workpad.py now`, e.g. 2026-05-05T17:42:11Z}

## Plan
- [ ] {step}

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {criterion mirrored from issue body}

## Reproduction
{captured signal — failing test, error log, or repro command. Section only present for `bug`-labelled issues.}

## Decisions / Notes
- {output of `workpad.py now`} — {append-only chronological note}

## Devflow Reflection
- {only when something was unclear, blocked, or deferred during execution}
```

### Workpad helper CLI

Every workpad operation goes through the bundled `workpad.py` helper at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/workpad.py`. The helper is stateless — each subcommand re-derives `REPO_FULL` and the marker on every invocation, so it works across Claude Code's per-call fresh-shell model without any env var or shell function needing to survive between Bash tool calls.

Subcommand reference:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `workpad.py id ISSUE` | Print the workpad comment ID, or exit 1 with empty stdout if none exists. |
| `workpad.py body COMMENT_ID` | Print the full body of an existing workpad. |
| `workpad.py create ISSUE BODY_FILE` | Create the workpad on a fresh issue and print the new comment ID. Use this exactly once per issue, in Phase 1.5. |
| `workpad.py update ISSUE [mutations...]` | Apply atomic mutations and PATCH. **This is the mutation entry point used at every phase boundary after creation.** See the flags below. |
| `workpad.py now` | Canonical UTC ISO-8601 timestamp. (`update` already refreshes `Last updated` automatically; use `now` only when you need a timestamp in some other string, e.g. a follow-up issue body.) |
| `workpad.py patch COMMENT_ID BODY_FILE` | Low-level body-file PATCH. Prefer `update`; only use this for bulk-rewrite cases the `update` flags don't cover. |

`workpad.py update` accepts (combinable, all optional):

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--status STATUS` | Replace the Status line. |
| `--branch BRANCH` | Replace the Branch line. |
| `--tick-plan TEXT` | Tick one unticked Plan checkbox whose text contains TEXT (substring). Fails if TEXT matches zero unticked checkboxes or multiple. **Repeatable** — pass multiple times to tick several boxes in one atomic update. |
| `--tick-ac TEXT` | Same, for Acceptance Criteria. **Repeatable.** |
| `--rewrite-ac OLD NEW` | Phase 2.2.6: find an AC by OLD substring, replace its full text with NEW, keep the box state. |
| `--note TEXT` | Append an auto-timestamped entry to Decisions / Notes. **Repeatable** — multiple notes in one call share the same timestamp and are appended in argument order. |
| `--reflection TEXT` | Append a bullet to Devflow Reflection (no timestamp). **Repeatable.** |
| `--replace-plan-file FILE` | Replace the Plan section content with FILE. |
| `--replace-acs-file FILE` | Phase 2.2.5: replace Acceptance Criteria content with FILE. |
| `--set-reproduction-file FILE` | Phase 2.1.5: set the Reproduction section to FILE; inserts the section after Acceptance Criteria if it doesn't yet exist. |

`update` always re-fetches the live body before mutating (this narrows but does not eliminate the clobber window for concurrent edits; acceptable because the orchestrator is the single writer in practice), always refreshes `Last updated`, and PATCHes atomically — within a single `update` call, all of its mutations apply or none do. The patched body is printed to stdout so callers can verify the change actually landed.

Helper invariants baked into the script (orchestrator doesn't need to enforce them):
- Decisions / Notes is append-only — `--note` only appends, never rewrites.
- Devflow Reflection accumulates bullets — `--reflection` only appends.
- `--tick-*` flags edit only the box character and preserve the rest of the line.
- `--rewrite-ac` preserves the original checkbox state (don't tick during a 2.2.6 rewrite — the gate ticks later via `--tick-ac`).
- Heredoc / shell-interpolation hazards are eliminated — body content never traverses bash quoting; everything goes through files.

The helper reads `claude.workpad_marker` from `.github/project-config.yml`, falling back to the built-in default `<!-- devflow:workpad -->` when the config file or key is absent (so it works with no config). It fails fast (exit 1 with a clear stderr message) when `gh` can't resolve the repo, when the underlying API call fails, or when a `--tick-*` / `--rewrite-ac` flag's substring matches zero or multiple checkboxes. `--tick-plan` / `--tick-ac` only consider unticked (`[ ]`) rows, so a duplicate tick in a single batched call surfaces as "no unticked checkbox matched" rather than silently no-op'ing.

**Never create a second workpad on the same issue.** Phase 1.5 creates exactly one; every subsequent mutation goes through `update`. If you lose `$ISSUE_NUMBER` mid-run (context compaction), recover from `git log`, `git branch --show-current`, and `gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current)` — then resume with `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER ...`.

When a workpad already exists at the start of a re-run, treat its `Decisions / Notes` and `Devflow Reflection` as load-bearing context — read them via `workpad.py body $(workpad.py id $ISSUE_NUMBER)` before deciding what to do next. If `Status` is `Blocked`, surface `Devflow Reflection` to the user and pause for confirmation before proceeding past Phase 1 — otherwise an automated re-run will blow through the gate that originally stopped the previous run.

**Always verify a Status PATCH actually landed.** `update` prints the new body on stdout — confirm the new `Status:` line is present before advancing to the next phase. (`gh api -X PATCH` can return success while the comment body is unchanged: transient API errors, oversized bodies, throttling.) If the response shows a stale `Status`, re-issue the `update` before continuing. Plan/Notes-only updates don't need this check.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

Output: `Phase 1/4: Setup — fetching issue and creating branch...`

### 1.1 Fetch the GitHub Issue

Run:
```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels,number
```

If this fails, stop immediately and report: "Error: Could not fetch GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS. Verify the issue number exists."

Save the issue title, body, labels, and number — you will use these throughout the workflow. Note whether the labels include `bug` — Phase 2.1.5 depends on it.

### 1.2 Create or Detect Feature Branch

Check if you're already on a feature branch (the GitHub Action creates one automatically):
```bash
git branch --show-current
```

If the current branch matches `claude/issue-*` or `issue-*`, use it — skip branch creation.

Otherwise, create a new branch. The canonical branch name is computed by the helper (handles slugification, unicode, length truncation, and collision suffixing deterministically):

Write the issue title (from the `gh issue view` above) to a temp file with the **Write tool** — `/tmp/devflow-issue-$ARGUMENTS-title.txt` — then derive the branch from it. Using `--title-file` instead of passing the title as a positional shell argument avoids breakage when the title contains quotes, backticks, or `$`.

```bash
git fetch origin main
BRANCH=$(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/branch-for-issue.py $ARGUMENTS --title-file /tmp/devflow-issue-$ARGUMENTS-title.txt)
git checkout -b "$BRANCH" origin/main
```

### 1.3 Push Branch

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

### 1.4 Parse Acceptance Criteria from the issue body

Run the bundled parser to extract `## Acceptance Criteria` and (optional) `## Test Plan` sections from the issue, pre-classifying each criterion as either code-verifiable or *post-merge*:

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/parse-acs.py --issue $ARGUMENTS > /tmp/acs-${ARGUMENTS}.md
```

The output is checkbox lines ready to splice into the workpad's `## Acceptance Criteria` section, with ` (post-merge)` appended to any criterion whose text matches the bundled trigger phrases (see `parse-acs.py`'s `POST_MERGE_TRIGGERS` list for what's matched). When no AC section exists, the helper prints `_(none provided in issue body)_` and Phase 3.4 passes trivially.

A post-merge criterion is **not** deferred work (that's the 2.2.5 rule) — the code is in-scope and ships in this PR; only the *verification* happens after merge. The Phase 3.4 gate ignores `(post-merge)`-tagged items for blocking; /pr-description in Phase 4.2 surfaces them as a `## Post-Merge Verification` checklist in the PR body.

**Orchestrator override authority.** The trigger-phrase classifier is a heuristic, not exhaustive. After running the helper, eyeball each criterion and override if needed:
- *Demote to code-verifiable* — when a matching phrase appears inside quoted/example text within the criterion rather than describing the verification step itself (e.g. the criterion quotes a function name that happens to contain "click"). Strip the ` (post-merge)` suffix in the file before mirroring.
- *Promote to post-merge* — when no trigger phrase matched but the criterion's intent clearly requires a live PR/deploy/CI environment. Append ` (post-merge)`.

Either kind of override goes into `Decisions / Notes` with a one-line reason.

A criterion that is partially live (mixed code + live concerns) is tagged post-merge — verify the code-part during /implement, leave the live-part for after-merge.

### 1.5 Initialize or Load the Workpad

Set `ISSUE_NUMBER=$ARGUMENTS` and check whether a workpad already exists for this issue:

```bash
ISSUE_NUMBER=$ARGUMENTS
WORKPAD_ID=$(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/workpad.py id "$ISSUE_NUMBER" || true)
```

- **`WORKPAD_ID` empty (fresh issue)** → Build the initial body to a temp file: `Status: Setup`, `Branch:` `$(git branch --show-current)`, a placeholder `Last updated:`, empty `## Plan` (filled in during 2.2), the AC contents from `/tmp/acs-${ARGUMENTS}.md` (produced by 1.4), no `## Reproduction` section yet (added in 2.1.5 if applicable), `## Decisions / Notes` seeded with one bullet like `- {now} — /implement run started`, and an empty `## Devflow Reflection`. Then `workpad.py create $ISSUE_NUMBER <tmp-file>`.
- **`WORKPAD_ID` non-empty (resume)** → Read the live body with `workpad.py body $WORKPAD_ID`. Treat its `Decisions / Notes` and `Devflow Reflection` as load-bearing context (see Workpad Reference). To reset for this run, apply: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Setup --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --note "/implement re-run started"`. If the issue's Acceptance Criteria section changed since the last run, also pass `--replace-acs-file /tmp/acs-${ARGUMENTS}.md`.

After this step, every later phase boundary touches the workpad via `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER ...` — no `WORKPAD_ID` variable to track across calls.

---

## Phase 2: Discover, Plan & Implement

Output: `Phase 2/4: Discover, Plan & Implement...`

Update the workpad: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Discovering --note "entered Phase 2"`.

### 2.1 Discovery

Use the **Agent tool** with `subagent_type: feature-dev:code-explorer` to explore the codebase and understand the system as it relates to the issue.

**Pick the exploration map first.** Default is `.docs.internal`. Override it when the issue scope sits outside app code — scan the issue body for path mentions (`.github/workflows/`, `.claude/`, `scripts/`, `cron/`, `tools/`, etc.) or a section headed "Technical Context", "Relevant files", "Files to touch", "Files to change", or "Implementation files"; collect those paths as `PRIMARY_PATHS` and instruct the explorer to read them first, falling back to `.docs.internal` only for gaps. Otherwise `PRIMARY_PATHS` stays empty and the default applies.

Pass the following prompt:
- The GitHub issue title, body, and labels
- **Explicit instruction:** "Start by reading {PRIMARY_PATHS if non-empty, otherwise the internal documentation path from `.github/project-config.yml` via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/config-get.sh .docs.internal docs/internal/`} and read relevant files under that path to understand the system architecture and identify which modules and files are relevant to this issue. Use the documentation as a map to guide your code exploration. Then explore the actual code guided by those findings. Return a distilled summary of: relevant files, current behavior, patterns used, dependencies, and anything the implementer needs to know."

Documentation updates are handled in Phase 4 by the `devflow:docs` subagent — it has the full picture (the shipped code, not just the plan) and the right mandate. Do not edit `.docs.internal` here; if the explorer surfaced outdated or missing docs, that signal carries forward in your context to Phase 4.1 where the subagent will act on it.

### 2.1.5 Reproduce-First Gate (only for `bug`-labelled issues)

If the issue's labels (saved in 1.1) **do not** include `bug`, skip this step entirely and continue to 2.2.

If the labels **do** include `bug`, you must capture a *reproduction signal* before planning a fix. A reproduction signal is any one of:

- a new failing test in the diff that exercises the bug,
- a quoted error log / stack trace from a real run, or
- a recorded shell command (with output) that demonstrates the failure.

Write the evidence to a temp file, then: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Reproducing --set-reproduction-file /tmp/repro-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md --note "captured reproduction signal"`. (The helper inserts `## Reproduction` after `## Acceptance Criteria` if it doesn't yet exist.)

**Temporary proof edits are allowed** when they raise confidence in the reproduction (e.g. inserting a `console.log`, hardcoding a request payload, tweaking a build input). Every temporary proof edit MUST be reverted before the implementation commit in 2.5, and the fact that you made one must be recorded in the workpad's `Reproduction` section so reviewers can follow the evidence.

**Phase 2.2 cannot start until the workpad's `Reproduction` section is populated.** If you cannot reproduce the bug: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Blocked --reflection "cannot reproduce: {obstacle}"`, then stop the run — do not invent a fix.

### 2.2 Assess Complexity & Plan

`workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Planning`.

Using the explorer's findings (and the reproduction signal, for bugs), evaluate the issue complexity:

**Simple issues** (implement directly — skip architect):
- Single-module changes (e.g., add a field, fix a bug, update a config)
- Clear solution described in the issue body
- No architectural decisions needed
- Touches ≤ 5 files

**Complex issues** (use architect subagent):
- Cross-module changes affecting multiple subsystems
- New features requiring design decisions
- Changes to interfaces, data models, or system architecture
- Ambiguous requirements needing breakdown into tasks

#### Path A: Simple issue

Output: `Skipping architect — issue is straightforward. Implementing directly.`

Plan the implementation inline using the explorer's findings. Identify which files to create/modify and what changes to make.

#### Path B: Complex issue

Use the **Agent tool** with `subagent_type: feature-dev:code-architect` to design the implementation.

Pass it:
- The full GitHub issue content (title, body, labels)
- The explorer's distilled findings as inline context, prefixed with: "The code-explorer analyzed the current codebase and produced the following findings:"

The architect returns a focused blueprint (files to create/modify, component designs, data flows, build sequence). Hold this blueprint in your context — do NOT commit it (it is a temporary working artifact).

After planning (either path), write the plan steps as `- [ ]` checkboxes to a temp file, then `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --replace-plan-file /tmp/plan-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md`.

#### 2.2.5 Scope-Adjustment Rule (multi-PR issues)

If discovery and planning revealed that the issue's deliverables span more than fits in a single PR (e.g., a phased cleanup, a multi-stage migration, or any issue whose acceptance criteria explicitly enumerate work for several future PRs), **you must narrow the workpad's `## Acceptance Criteria` to only the items this PR will deliver** before continuing to 2.3. Otherwise the Phase 3.4 gate will reject your run for criteria that are out-of-scope by design, and the run will stop without ever reaching Phase 4.

Steps when scoping down:

1. Write the narrowed AC list (only in-scope checkboxes, verbatim) to a temp file, e.g. `/tmp/narrowed-acs-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md`.
2. Apply the change atomically:
   ```bash
   workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER \
       --replace-acs-file /tmp/narrowed-acs-${ISSUE_NUMBER}.md \
       --note "scope decision: {which subset this PR delivers}. Deferred (verbatim): {list}. Will be tracked in follow-up issue(s) filed in Phase 4.0."
   ```

This is not "inventing" criteria (forbidden by 1.4) — the deferred items are preserved verbatim in `Decisions / Notes` and carried forward by Phase 4.0.

If you are unsure whether to scope down, prefer a single fully-in-scope PR. Only re-scope when the issue body itself describes phased work or the diff would otherwise exceed reasonable PR size.

#### 2.2.6 AC-Plan reconciliation (rewrite surface details, never relax intent)

Some ACs name specific identifiers (job names, file paths, function names, command names). If the plan you settled on — or a later refactor in /simplify (3.2) or /review-and-fix (3.3) — uses different identifiers for the *same underlying behavior*, the literal AC text becomes stale and Phase 3.4 will reject a strictly-correct refactor. You may rewrite the affected AC in the workpad **only if** the rewritten text verifies the same observable outcome with the new identifiers; never relax what's verified.

Reconciliation steps:
```bash
workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER \
    --rewrite-ac "{OLD AC substring}" "{NEW AC text}" \
    --note "AC rewrite: {old verbatim} → {new}. Motivated by: {structural change}"
```
`--rewrite-ac` preserves the box state (don't tick during the rewrite — Phase 3.4 will tick via `--tick-ac` later). This is **not** scope adjustment — the rewritten AC is still gated in 3.4.

If the rewrite would relax the AC (drop a guarantee, weaken a check, remove a verification surface), STOP — apply 2.2.5 (defer the AC to a follow-up issue) or revert the structural change instead.

### 2.3 Implement

`workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Implementing`.

Now implement the feature yourself. You have full context:
- The explorer's system understanding
- The architect's blueprint (if complex) or your own inline plan (if simple)
- The original issue requirements

Write the code. Follow the patterns and conventions described in `CLAUDE.md`. As plan steps complete, tick them off: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --tick-plan "{substring of completed step}"`.

#### 2.3.1 Orphaned-setup sweep (mandatory whenever the change deletes code)

Removing a call site, a UI block, a branch, or a whole function almost always strands the *setup lines* that fed it — a service-locator/dependency fetch, a query or record lookup, a computed local, an import or `use` clause — whose only consumer was the code you just deleted. These survive `git diff` review because nothing is *syntactically* broken; the line is simply dead. Reviewers keep flagging them as "optional cleanup", which means the PR shipped imperfect.

After every deletion, before running tests, do this sweep:

1. List the functions/methods/templates your diff removed lines from (`git diff --staged -U0` or `git diff -U0`).
2. For each one, re-read the **whole** surrounding function in its post-edit state.
3. Delete any local that is now assigned but never read, and any import / `use` clause / dependency declaration that lost its only consumer.
4. If something is *still* used elsewhere in the function, leave it; this sweep removes only genuinely-orphaned lines, never live ones — and never touch functions the diff didn't already modify.

Treat a leftover orphaned setup line as a defect in **this** PR, not a pre-existing-dead-code excuse — if the diff touched the function, the function leaves clean.

#### 2.3.2 Stranded-dependents sweep (mandatory whenever the change deletes a method, file, route, or page)

2.3.1 prunes dead lines *inside* the functions you touched. This sweep handles the inverse blast radius — the things *outside* your diff that the deletion stranded. When a removal/cleanup PR deletes its primary target, it routinely leaves dangling artifacts the deletion stripped of purpose: now-callerless public methods, leftover asset files, dead arguments still being passed to a callee that stopped reading them, and — worst — *surviving* pages, links, menu entries, or route references that still point at the code you just deleted (a guaranteed 404 / fatal for users).

After deleting any public method, class, file, page, route, endpoint, asset, or template, before running tests, do this sweep:

1. **Now-orphaned public surfaces.** For every public method or function you removed the *callers* of (not the function itself), and for every file/asset the just-deleted code was the sole consumer of: grep the whole repo for remaining references. Zero references → it is part of *this* removal; delete it too. (E.g. a public method left as a zombie with zero callers after its only caller was removed; an image/template asset left after its sole consumer was deleted.)
2. **Dead arguments to changed callees.** For every callee whose signature or body you changed so it stops reading some inputs: re-check each call site and stop passing the now-ignored arguments/keys. (E.g. a caller still passing several now-dead keys into a helper after the receiver stopped reading them.)
3. **Surviving inbound links and route refs.** For every page, route, endpoint, or file path you deleted: grep the repo for that path/URL/route name (links in templates, menu/nav configs, `href`s, redirects, route tables, sitemap entries). Every surviving reference is a regression — remove the link, or restore the target if it was deleted in error. (E.g. a navigation page still linking to a sub-page after that sub-page's source file was deleted → users hit a 404.)
4. **In-scope subtree completeness.** If the issue scopes a directory/feature subtree for removal, walk the *whole* subtree — do not stop at the files the obvious entry points reference. An untraversed leaf page that still calls the deleted integration is in scope by definition. (E.g. an orphan leaf file left in place still calling the deleted integration, linked from a surviving index page, despite sitting inside the in-scope subtree.)

Treat any stranded dependent as a defect in **this** PR. A deletion PR is not done until grepping for the deleted symbols/paths returns nothing but the deletion itself.

**Scope boundary with Phase 4.1 (*Update Documentation*).** This sweep covers references in *code, config, and routing tables* — i.e. things that break behavior at runtime if left dangling. Prose references to the deleted symbols/paths inside `docs/internal/` (descriptions, walkthroughs, "to install X, do Y") are **not** in scope here; they are handled by the Phase 4.1 documentation pass (`devflow:docs` subagent). If your grep turns up only docs hits, note them and move on — do not edit `docs/internal/` from this phase.

#### 2.3.3 Convention-compliance sweep on touched code (mandatory)

Same principle as 2.3.1, applied to `CLAUDE.md` conventions instead of dead code: **any function, method, query, or new file your diff added or modified lines in must conform to the conventions in `CLAUDE.md` when you leave it** — even if the violation was already there before you touched it, and even if "everything around it does it the same way." Recurring offenders that reviewers keep flagging as *Important* and that then ship anyway:

- A function signature left non-conforming after you edited it (e.g. argument shape, parameter style, return type) — whatever the project's CLAUDE.md mandates for function definitions in that language.
- A raw query/literal string in code you touched that violates the project's style rules (quoting, casing, identifier escaping) — whatever the project's CLAUDE.md mandates for embedded queries or literals.
- A new variable, method, file, or identifier you introduced that copies a legacy misspelling or non-conforming name from a sibling file — whatever the project's CLAUDE.md mandates for naming. "It matches the established convention across the existing code" is **not** a valid reason to propagate a misspelled or non-conforming name into new code; name the new thing correctly.

After implementing, before running tests, do this sweep:

1. From `git diff --staged -U0` (or `git diff -U0`), list every function/method/query/new file your diff added or changed lines in.
2. Re-read each one in its post-edit state and check it against the rules in `CLAUDE.md` that apply to the languages and surfaces your diff touched.
3. Fix any violation in code the diff already touches. If fixing it cleanly is genuinely out of scope (it would balloon the diff into an unrelated refactor), say so explicitly in the workpad `Decisions / Notes` with the reason — do not leave it silent for `/review` to catch.
4. Do not reformat or rename code the diff didn't otherwise touch — this sweep covers only lines/functions/files your change already modified or introduced, never a repo-wide cleanup.

Treat a known convention violation in touched code as a defect in **this** PR, not a pre-existing-style excuse — if the diff touched it, it leaves `CLAUDE.md`-compliant.

### 2.4 Test

Run the project's test and lint commands (check `CLAUDE.md` or `README`). Issue both Bash calls in a single assistant turn so they run in parallel.

- If **both pass** → proceed to committing.
- If **either fails** → fix the failing tests/lint errors yourself (you wrote the code, you have full context). Re-run the failing command(s) to verify.

### 2.5 Commit Implementation

For `bug`-labelled issues: confirm any temporary proof edits made in 2.1.5 have been reverted. Verify with `git diff HEAD` and `git diff --staged`. The working tree about to be committed must NOT include any stray `console.log`s, hardcoded payloads, or other proof-only edits.

Stage and commit all implementation changes:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement issue #$ARGUMENTS — {short description from issue title}"
git push
```

If the commit includes test fixes, use a single commit combining implementation and fixes.

**⚠ You are NOT done. Code is committed but not reviewed or documented. Proceed to Phase 3.**

---

## Phase 3: Review & Fix

Output: `Phase 3/4: Review & Fix — creating PR and running review...`

`workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Reviewing`.

### 3.1 Create Draft PR

```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "{issue title}" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Work in progress — automated review pending.

Resolves #{issue_number}

Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) via `/implement $ARGUMENTS`
EOF
)"
```

### 3.2 Self-Review with /simplify

Invoke the **Skill tool** with `skill: simplify`.

This runs three review agents in parallel — code-reuse, code-quality, efficiency — and fixes any concrete issues they flag in the diff. It is a fast, single-pass self-review that catches the kinds of issues (existing-utility duplication, hacky patterns, redundant work, unnecessary commentary) that the heavier `review-and-fix` engine in 3.3 would otherwise spend turns on. Running it here keeps 3.3 focused on correctness, contracts, and verification rather than quality nits.

After the skill completes, commit any fixes and push:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: address /simplify findings for issue #$ARGUMENTS"
git push
```

If `/simplify` reported the code was already clean and made no changes, skip the commit and continue.

### 3.3 Review & Fix

Invoke the **Skill tool** with `skill: review-and-fix`.

This runs the four-phase review engine in your context:
1. **Verification checklist** — generates and verifies every dependency interaction, test-mock alignment, data format assumption, and API contract claim against actual source code
2. **Existing review agents** — runs pr-review-toolkit (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, comment-analyzer, pr-test-analyzer) and superpowers code-reviewer in parallel
3. **Automatic fix loop** — fixes findings using receiving-code-review principles, re-runs the engine, loops until APPROVE or max 4 iterations

Follow the skill's instructions. It handles evaluation, fixing, testing, and re-review internally.

After the skill completes (verdict: APPROVE), commit any fixes and push:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback for issue #$ARGUMENTS"
git push
```

If the skill exits with unresolved findings after 4 iterations: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Blocked --reflection "review-and-fix unresolved after 4 iterations: {summary}"`, then stop.

### 3.4 Acceptance Criteria Gate

Before advancing to Phase 4, verify every **non-post-merge** checkbox in the workpad's `## Acceptance Criteria` section is ticked (`- [x]`). For each criterion, the verification is one of:

- a passing test in the diff that demonstrates the criterion,
- a documented manual check (recorded in `Decisions / Notes` with the result), or
- a code reference (file:line) that satisfies the criterion.

Tick each criterion as you confirm it: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --tick-ac "{substring of AC text}"`. Cite the verification (a test, a file:line, or a Decisions/Notes entry) in a `--note` on the same call where helpful.

**Post-merge criteria are exempt from the gate.** A criterion whose checkbox line ends in `(post-merge)` (tagged during Phase 1.4) does not block. The orchestrator's responsibility for a post-merge criterion ends at "the code reaches the state where the live verification *becomes possible* to run." Leave the checkbox unticked — the merger will tick it after deploy via the `## Post-Merge Verification` section that `/pr-description` adds to the PR body in Phase 4.2. Do **not** invent evidence to tick a post-merge box during /implement; the live signal is what counts.

If the workpad's Acceptance Criteria section reads `_(none provided in issue body)_`, the gate passes trivially.

The gate applies only to criteria currently in the workpad's `## Acceptance Criteria` section. If you scoped down via the 2.2.5 rule, deferred criteria live in `Decisions / Notes` and are **not** gated here — they will be carried into a follow-up issue in Phase 4.0.

If non-post-merge criteria remain unchecked after Phase 3.3:

1. If a criterion is satisfiable with a small follow-up edit, do it now (still inside Phase 3) — write the code, run tests, commit (using the `fix:` prefix), tick the box, and continue.
2. If a criterion's *literal text* is now stale because /simplify or /review-and-fix refactored the structure (e.g. renamed jobs, merged files), but the *underlying behavior* the criterion verifies is preserved in the diff, apply **2.2.6** now: rewrite the AC text in the workpad with a `Decisions / Notes` paper trail, then tick the box.
3. If a criterion is genuinely outside this PR's scope and you missed it during 2.2.5, **go back to 2.2.5 now**: move the item to `Decisions / Notes` as deferred, rewrite the Acceptance Criteria section, PATCH, and re-run this gate against the narrowed set. Then continue to Phase 4.
4. Otherwise — i.e. the criterion is in-scope but you cannot satisfy it AND it is not tagged `(post-merge)` — `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Blocked --reflection "AC unmet (in-scope, not post-merge): {AC text}"`, then stop the run with a clear report to the user. Do **not** advance to Phase 4 with unmet in-scope, non-post-merge criteria.

(A criterion that the orchestrator can't satisfy AND that's clearly post-merge-only should have been tagged `(post-merge)` in Phase 1.4 — if it wasn't, retroactively retag with `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --rewrite-ac "{old text}" "{old text} (post-merge)" --note "retro-tagged as post-merge: {reason}"`, then let it pass the gate.)

**⚠ You are NOT done. PR is still a draft and needs documentation and a proper description. Proceed to Phase 4.**

## Phase 4: Documentation

Output: `Phase 4/4: Documentation — updating docs and finalizing PR...`

`workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --status Documenting`.

### 4.0 File Follow-Up Issues for Deferred Work

If Phase 2.2.5's scope-adjustment rule deferred any acceptance criteria, file a follow-up GitHub issue capturing them now. Skip this step if no criteria were deferred.

For each logical chunk of deferred work (typically: one issue per remaining "phase" in a phased cleanup), create a GitHub issue. If multiple follow-up issues are needed, issue all `gh issue create` calls in a single assistant turn so they run in parallel, and append a single combined `Decisions / Notes` entry afterward (do not PATCH the workpad between each `gh issue create`):

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "<short descriptive title — e.g. 'Phase N of <parent topic>'>" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Follow-up to #$ARGUMENTS — captures deferred acceptance criteria from that issue's /implement run.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {deferred criterion verbatim}
- [ ] {deferred criterion verbatim}
…

## Context
The parent issue #$ARGUMENTS spans multiple PRs. This follow-up tracks the work that the parent's /implement run scoped out — see the workpad on #$ARGUMENTS for the full scope decision.
EOF
)"
```

Record the new issue numbers in the workpad: `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --note "Filed follow-up issues for deferred work: #N (phase 2), #N+1 (phase 3), …"` before continuing to 4.0.5.

### 4.0.5 File Follow-Up Issues for Deferred Review Findings

If Phase 3.3's /devflow:review-and-fix run emitted a deferrals manifest (`.devflow/review/<slug>/deferrals.json` — see that skill's "Pre-mapping: Widens-surface guard + deferrals manifest" section for what's in it), file follow-up GitHub issues for those findings now and update the manifest in place with the assigned issue numbers + deterministic deferral IDs. Phase 4.2's /pr-description run will then surface them in the PR body as a Scope-Acknowledged Findings block that /devflow:review's verdict matcher honors.

Skip this step if the manifest does not exist or is empty.

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
DEFERRALS_FILE=".devflow/review/pr-${PR_NUMBER}/deferrals.json"
if [ -s "$DEFERRALS_FILE" ]; then
    FILED_NUMBERS=$(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/file-deferrals.py \
        --source-issue $ARGUMENTS \
        --pr "$PR_NUMBER" \
        --manifest "$DEFERRALS_FILE")
fi
```

The helper groups manifest entries by `file` (one issue per source file), files each issue with a repo-agnostic title/body template (`<area>: deferred review findings in <file> (carried from #<source_issue>)` and a body containing the verbatim findings plus the `PR #<pr_number>` substring that the verdict matcher's mutual-cross-link guard validates against), then rewrites the manifest in place with `id: dfr-<6-hex>` (deterministic hash of `file + symbol + kind + summary`) and `follow_up: {issue, url, filed_at, filed_by}` populated per entry. Filed issue numbers are printed to stdout, one per line.

Failure mode: if `gh issue create` fails for a particular file-group, that group's entries are dropped from the manifest entirely — no fake deferral can downgrade a future review. The helper exits 0 as long as at least one group succeeded. Capture stderr in your `Devflow Reflection` notes if anything was dropped.

Record the filed issue numbers in the workpad:

```bash
if [ -n "${FILED_NUMBERS:-}" ]; then
    NUMBERS_CSV=$(echo "$FILED_NUMBERS" | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//' | sed 's/,/, #/g')
    workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER --note "Filed follow-up issues for deferred review findings: #${NUMBERS_CSV}"
fi
```

If the helper exits non-zero (every group failed), surface the failure to the workpad's Devflow Reflection (`--reflection "file-deferrals.py failed; no follow-up issues filed; PR body will not contain the Scope-Acknowledged Findings block — /devflow:review will treat any deferred findings as new"`) and continue to 4.1. The PR can still ship; it will just not enjoy the deferral demotion on next review.

### 4.1 Update Documentation

Spawn a **subagent** (using the Agent tool) and instruct it to invoke the `devflow:docs` skill. Pass it:
- The GitHub issue title, body, and number
- Instruction: "Invoke the `devflow:docs` skill to update all documentation (internal docs, external docs, release notes). The issue context is provided for release notes generation."

After the subagent completes, commit any documentation changes. Read the docs paths from `.github/project-config.yml`:

```bash
DOCS_INTERNAL=$(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/config-get.sh .docs.internal docs/internal/)
DOCS_EXTERNAL=$(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/config-get.sh .docs.external docs/external/)
git status -- "$DOCS_INTERNAL" "$DOCS_EXTERNAL"
```

If there are changes:
```bash
git add "$DOCS_INTERNAL" "$DOCS_EXTERNAL"
git commit -m "docs: update documentation for issue #$ARGUMENTS"
git push
```

Then add the "Documented" label to mark that the docs pass ran. The label signals "the docs pass ran and was reviewed", so apply it when the docs subagent actually ran — either it produced changes (and you committed them above), or it returned cleanly with no changes needed. Skip the label and add a `--reflection` note to the workpad instead when the docs subagent failed, returned no useful output, or was unable to run. (Downstream docs automation, if the adopter runs any, can key off this label to avoid double-processing the PR.)

```bash
DOCUMENTED_LABEL=$(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/config-get.sh .docs.documented_label Documented)
gh pr edit --add-label "$DOCUMENTED_LABEL"
```

### 4.2 Generate PR Description

Invoke the **Skill tool** with `skill: "pr-description"` and `args: "$ARGUMENTS"` (the issue number). The skill detects the existing PR and updates its body directly.

Verify the PR Description update landed before moving to the next step.

```bash
gh pr view --json body --jq '.body' | grep -q "Work in progress — automated review pending" && echo "STILL PLACEHOLDER" || echo "OK"
```


### 4.3 Mark PR as Ready and Finalize Workpad

```bash
gh pr ready
```

Then finalize the workpad in one call:

```bash
workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER \
    --status Complete \
    --note "/implement run finished, PR marked ready: <PR_URL>" \
    [--reflection "{noteworthy event}" ...repeat per event]
```

Add one `--reflection` flag per noteworthy event a human should know for troubleshooting: a failed step that was skipped, a subagent that returned no useful output, a permission denial, a test you couldn't run, an ambiguity you resolved with an assumption, or any deviation from the planned flow. `--reflection` is repeatable so all events land in a single atomic update. (No separate "Notes from /implement run" comment is posted — the workpad replaces it.)

Then output the PR URL and a one- or two-line summary of what was accomplished.

## Completion Checklist

Before reporting completion, verify ALL phases executed:

- Phase 1: Issue fetched, branch exists, workpad initialized with Acceptance Criteria mirrored
- Phase 2: For `bug`-labelled issues, reproduction signal recorded; if the issue spans multiple PRs, the 2.2.5 scope-adjustment rule was applied and the workpad's Acceptance Criteria section now contains only in-scope items; code committed and pushed
- Phase 3: Draft PR created, `/simplify` ran (fixes committed if any), `/review-and-fix` ran, acceptance criteria gate passed (PR still draft)
- Phase 4: If any criteria were deferred in 2.2.5, follow-up issue(s) filed in 4.0; if /devflow:review-and-fix emitted a deferrals manifest, follow-up issue(s) filed in 4.0.5 and the manifest hydrated; docs updated and "Documented" label applied; PR description generated via `/pr-description`; PR marked ready; workpad finalized with `Status: Complete`

Verify each `Status` PATCH actually landed at the time it was issued (see the Update protocol's "Always verify a PATCH that changes `Status` actually landed" rule). If a phase was skipped or a `Status` PATCH didn't land, go back and complete it now. In particular:

- **Do not stop after the PR is created or after review approves** — the PR stays a draft until Phase 4.3.
- **Do not stop because acceptance criteria are unchecked when the issue itself is multi-PR** — apply the 2.2.5 scope-adjustment rule first, then re-run the gate. The "Status: Blocked, stop the run" path in Phase 3.4 is only for genuinely-failing in-scope criteria, never for scope mismatches.

---

## Error Handling

- **Empty steps**: If any phase produces no file changes, skip the commit and continue. Do not create empty commits.
- **Git conflicts**: If a push fails due to conflicts, run `git pull --rebase origin {branch}` and retry once. If it fails again, stop and report the error.
- **Subagent failures**: If a subagent fails or produces no useful output, note the failure in the workpad's `Devflow Reflection` and continue to the next step. Do not retry the same subagent more than once.
- **Permission denials**: If a Bash command is denied, note it in the workpad and continue to the next step. Never skip an entire phase because of a single denied command.
- **Commit prefixes**: Use `docs:` for documentation, `feat:` for implementation, `fix:` for review fixes and test fixes.
- **Context recovery**: If context was compressed and you lose track of variables, recover from `git log`, `git branch --show-current`, `gh pr list --head {branch}`, and the workpad — `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/workpad.py body $(${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/workpad.py id $ISSUE_NUMBER)`. The workpad is the source of truth for plan state and every later mutation goes through `workpad.py update $ISSUE_NUMBER`, so the only variable to recover is `$ISSUE_NUMBER` itself (and it's already in `$ARGUMENTS`).
- **Surfacing failures**: Anything you "note the failure and continue" on above goes into the workpad's `Devflow Reflection` section so a human can pick it up later. Track these as you go — by the time Phase 4.3 runs, they should already be in the workpad, and no separate end-of-run issue comment is needed.
